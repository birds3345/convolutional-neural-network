# convolutional-neural-network

An implementation of a convolutional neural network from scratch. This project is not meant to be used for production and was created for educational purposes.

I also tried to derive the math myself, and therefore some of the math may be incorrect (but it works as far as I can tell).

The neural network achieved an accuracy of around 80% after training.
